# Case Study: V-Learn - Visualize the learning : problem statement

Programming has become the biggest trend among Indian schoolchildren. There are various pathways that allow high school students to demonstrate their programming abilities by contributing to open-source projects. While these programs can provide a great introduction to computer programming, they also lack a number of important features that we think are necessary to help & create the next generation of effective independent computer programmers. 
 
It's crucial to visualize and understand the syntax in order to develop solid coding concepts, due to which our platform focuses on the visualization of various data structure algorithms along with providing various resources which could help students. Thus helping to revolutionize the coding experience for students.

# What is so good about us?

Here at V-Learn, you'll be able to find various feature you are searching for. A designated place for all the software features That are availble on the internet . We provide proper description of along with the chatbot to how to use the feature. 
 
The feature available in V Learn .
<br /> ->VISUALIZE ALGORITHMS.
<br /> ->DRAG & DROP PROGRAMMING
<br /> ->DISCUSSION FORUM
<br /> ->AI based Code to english explainer
<br /> ->CONTESTS
<br /> ->AI NAVIGATION
<br /> ->PROFILE

Now we are taking this time to introduce you guys with the web thing of our company which is basically a website.

# Description of the V-learn
The complex Data Structures and Algorithms can be animated and their working can be viewed for better understanding.Learning programming can be made effective by dragging and dropping the code components and thus generating the code.There will be a discussion forum where the students can post their questions and they can be answered by anyone who is willing to help.There will also be a CSV file visualization section which will help make the students acquainted with the various concepts of datasets.The contests taking place in various coding platforms will be made available to the students in order to get them acquainted with real-world problem-solving skills.A voice bot will be integrated which will help user with various question and help them to navigate various pages of the website.The profile section will keep track of the various activities performed by the students, badges, and points will also be rewarded for consistent practice on the platform.
